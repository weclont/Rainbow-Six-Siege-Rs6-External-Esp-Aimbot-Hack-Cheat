## Info
The source codes of the cheat have been leaked. The cheat is currently undetected, but I am not responsible if it is detected later and you are banned from the game
Scavs (White), PMCs (White,Pink)), ScavBoss (Green)
Avoiding the use of any sort of detected vectors by only hooking WndProc, which is called whenever mouse movement /key stroke is given. The textures from the .manifest and .bundle files were edited. There are some methods that allow the user to bypass the consistency check. Bypass used: Files must have the right file size as the original ones.Removes ambient sounds like wind noise, water flow, rain etc
Note: It draws ESP for all players and sometimes for our own player too.
Aimbot source is already implemented but not functional.. check the source if you want to enable it.a Rename the config.example.json in the examples folder to config.json, add your credentials, add a storage path, and then yarn.

## Disclaimer
I also wanted to try out some Evasion Techniques. If you want a really secure cheat loader the code and logic should really be improved and you would have to add some features to secure it. I would advise you to create your own with the only goal to safely distribute your cheat. Check the link below if you really want to create your own and learn game hacking. (Btw I would not advise you to use SSL for a paycheat, no need to reinvent the wheel just use HTTPS). Anyway it will still work fine and provide very basic security features if you do not sell extremely expensive cheats and don't want to create your own. It's currently more like a dll injector than a loader
